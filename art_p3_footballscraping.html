		<p>Football, being one of if not the most popular sport in the world, has quite a few adepts in the Data Science sphere. When a colleague asked me to get him the information for several leagues in the last two seasons I knew I could count on the open source community to have <em>something</em> to guide me in the right direction. </p>
		
		<p>Using Owen Seymour&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/oseymour/ScraperFC">ScraperFC</a> we can easily get the results for whole regular seasons at a time! I used the library&#39;s FBRef module that lets us get results for the most popular leagues easily. </p>
		
		<p>This is the gist of the code that will create a Pandas DataFrame for a given league and year:</p>

		<p>Now the real challenge will be, how to get the information for the lesser-known leagues? I am still working on that! </p>
